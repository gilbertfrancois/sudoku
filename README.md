# Sudoku solver
_Gilbert Fran√ßois Duivesteijn_

## Abstract

This a terminal application that tries to solve your sudoku puzzle. It reads the initial state from a file and when
it finds a solution, it prints the final state to the terminal. Note: the console output is VT100 compatible :)
The implemented methods to solve the sudoku puzzles are not sophisticated yet. It is based on counting probabitities 
and doing permutations when there are no deterministic solutions possible. The application in its current state can
solve the _easy_ and _medium_ levels without problems. The _hard_ level is possible too, but it might need multiple runs
to converge. In the near future, I'll plan to implement more advanced ways to solve the puzzles, which hopefully allows 
the machine to solve the most difficult puzzles as well.


## Installation and running

Install python version 3.10 or higher. It was a explicit choice to write the program in plain python, without any 
external libraries, like numpy. Although it could be much more efficient with numpy, the code looks much closer to a
plain C implementation, which I'm planning to do when the python implementation is stable.

Run the program with:

```sh
python sudoku [options] <filename>
```
where filename points to the input file. Options are:

| option  | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| -h      | Shows help message and exits.|
| -s / --max-steps | Maximum number of steps to solve the puzzle. Default = 10000.  |
| -v / --verbose   | Verbose output, showing history and elapsed computational time.|

## Data file format

The input file can have 2 different formats: grid format or list format. The grid format
expects the digits in 9 by 9 grid, where the empty cells are denoted by a dot. 

```
.9. .1. ..7
..5 76. ..4
.2. ... ..6

.5. .7. 9..
... ... ...
4.. .8. ..1

... 2.6 ...
..2 ..8 1..
.8. .5. 3..
```
Adding spaces or white lines is allowed.

The list format consists of a list with digits and its position as `row col digit`, e.g.:
```
# row col digit
1 2 9
1 5 1
1 9 7
2 3 5 
2 4 7
(.... etc)

```
There are some example data files in the `examples` folder.
