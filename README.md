# Sudoku Solver
_Gilbert Fran√ßois Duivesteijn_

## Abstract

This a terminal application that solves all your sudoku puzzles. It reads the initial state from a file and solves the puzzle. The implemented method to solve the sudoku puzzles is as simple as beautiful. It searches for an empty cell and fills in the first possible digit. Then it calls its own function to find the next possible digit. As soon as the solver is stuck, it unrolls to the previous state and tries the next possible number, until it has solved all cells in the puzzle. The application in its current state can solve the _easy_, _medium_, _hard_, _expert_ and _evil_ levels without problems. Moreover, when the puzzle has a non-unique solution, it finds all possible solutions!



There are 2 versions of this program. One written in **C** and one in **Python**. *The C version is approximately 40 to 80 times faster.*

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Python version, runtime: 0.00265 seconds.                  | C version, runtime: 0.00006 seconds.                      |




## Building and running the C version

Compile the program with:

```sh
cd cc
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```



Run the program with:

```sh
cd dist
./sudoku <filename>

# example
./sudoku ../../examples/easy_001.txt
```



## Running the python version

Install Python version 3.10 or higher. Run the program with:

```sh
cd py/src/
python sudoku.py <filename>

# example
python sudoku.py ../../examples/easy_001.txt
```



## Data file format

The input file can have 2 different formats: grid format or list format. The grid format expects the digits in 9 by 9 grid, where the empty cells are denoted by a dot. 

```
.9. .1. ..7
..5 76. ..4
.2. ... ..6

.5. .7. 9..
... ... ...
4.. .8. ..1

... 2.6 ...
..2 ..8 1..
.8. .5. 3..
```
There are some example data files in the `examples` folder.



## Nerd section



### C

To do...



### Python

Besides building a very robust solver, much effort has been put in making beautiful pure python code.  It was a explicit choice to write the program in plain python, without any external libraries, like numpy.

The application has been developed with the following code quality tools:

- [Type hints.](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/typing.html)
- [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for formatting.
- [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for sorting imports.
- [pdb++](https://github.com/pdbpp/pdbpp) for visual debugging in the terminal.
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management.
- [pylint](https://pylint.org) for checking code quality.
```sh
$ pylint src/sudoku.py
